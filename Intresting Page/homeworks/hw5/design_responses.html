                            The app in above picture is my favorite. It start with simple interface, when you swipe it
                            or
                            click it, it trun to new page smoothly. It is a very comprehensive design which contanis
                            lots of function(or area) so it can meet all the need of using of this "health food app".It
                            can check the calories of the food, record your food(note), check graph of the activities,
                            check account information and ect... The color used very approperate, I feel very
                            comfortable of this page, when I look at it.

                            I was wondering why there is no text. After I really read this page, I took long time to
                            check it and think. I really learned something.</p>
