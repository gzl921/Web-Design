				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned that Dark Patterns are sneaky design choices meant to trick users into things they
							don’t want, like buying stuff they didn’t mean to. They’re not just mistakes but are built
							on understanding how people think. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part was about 'Bait and Switch', where you think you're doing one thing, but it
							turns out to be another. Like, you try to close a pop-up, but it ends up starting an update
							instead.

						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> “Dark patterns...are not mistakes. They’re carefully crafted with a solid understanding of
							human psychology, and they do not have the user’s interest in mind.” </p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>

							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
