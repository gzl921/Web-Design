    <ul>
        <li>1. It helps me changed angle to look at an app. I will think more when I look at app in "designer
            perspective", like how does the design guide your focus, What content is visible and more interestingly,
            what content isn’t, Why would someone open this app and ect.</li>
        <li>2. I like the part "Don’t just use apps, study them", because I really learned somthing and it is short,
            easy to read.</li>
        <li>3. "Don’t just use apps, study them
            You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product. Open an app you use often
            and resist the urge to start scrolling through content. Instead, I want you to actively focus on the screen
            in front of you."</li>
