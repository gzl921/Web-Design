				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> The ideal timing for animations in user interfaces is between 200 to 500 milliseconds
							because it aligns with how our brain processes visual changes. The importance of timing in
							UX animation—animations should be quick enough to be smooth and responsive, yet slow enough
							to be noticeable. This balance is crucial in creating an engaging and efficient user
							experience.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part was learning about the impact of screen size on animation timing. It's
							interesting that animation duration should be adjusted based on the device—longer for larger
							tablet screens and shorter for smaller wearable screens. This reflects an understanding of
							user experience across different devices. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Numerous researches have discovered that optimal speed for interface animation is between
							200 and 500 ms. These figures are based on the particular qualities of the human brain."
