				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it
							using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to
							let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
						<p>Website: <a href="https://poki.com/">poki.com</a></p>
						<img src="assets/imgs/webpage.png" />
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for
							the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.
						</p>

					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this?
							Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
						<p>The goal of the website is let people to play games, and I think it is intended for all
							people, probably mainly to young age.
							Actually, I think this is a well designed website. There doesn't need to be too much text.
							The first impression of this page to people is attractive games. It makes people looking
							around,
							very interesting.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
						<p> To me, it makes more sense if I can see all the game types once I open the page. So I just
							changed the order of the page, making it emphasize the type first. </p>
					</li>
					<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just
						put it in your assets folder!</p>
					</li>
					<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
					<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png" />
